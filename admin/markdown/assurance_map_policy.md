# Retail Stride | MAP & Channel Policy  
*(Last updated: November 2025)*

---

## 1. Purpose  
This policy establishes the Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) and channel compliance standards that govern all products distributed by **Retail Stride LLC** (“Retail Stride”).  
Our goal is to maintain brand integrity, protect authorized sales channels, and ensure fair market conditions for all participating partners.

---

## 2. Scope  
This policy applies to all:
- Retailers and resellers within the Retail Stride verified network  
- Marketing and sales channels where Retail Stride–distributed products may appear  
- Digital representations of partner brands, including websites, advertisements, and promotional listings  

All Retail Stride partners must comply as a condition of ongoing participation in our network.

---

## 3. MAP Standards  
Each brand partner establishes its own **Minimum Advertised Price (MAP)** policy. Retail Stride enforces and monitors compliance through automated and manual reviews.

**Key Principles:**
- No Retail Stride partner may advertise below the brand’s published MAP.  
- MAP applies to all public-facing media, including websites, ads, emails, and printed materials.  
- Pricing displayed “in cart” or after login may differ only if explicitly permitted by brand policy.  
- Temporary promotions or bundle offers must be pre-approved in writing by the brand or Retail Stride compliance team.

Violations may result in suspension or permanent removal from the Retail Stride network.

## 4. Channel Restrictions  
To protect brand presentation and channel integrity:

- Retail Stride–distributed products **may not be sold** on open third-party marketplaces (e.g., Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Facebook Marketplace) without **written authorization**.  
- Approved retailers are limited to **their owned storefront(s)** and official websites.  
- Products may not be resold, wholesaled, or transferred to any unauthorized third party.  
- Brand trademarks, photography, or descriptions may only be used in approved retail contexts.

Retail Stride enforces these restrictions across all accounts via internal audits, purchase traceability, and network monitoring tools.

---

## 5. Enforcement & Compliance  
Retail Stride reserves the right to:
- Investigate potential violations at any time  
- Request proof of compliance (receipts, listings, screenshots, or web data)  
- Suspend or terminate retailer access for non-compliance  
- Notify brand partners of any confirmed or suspected policy breaches  

Repeat or deliberate violations may result in permanent network exclusion.
