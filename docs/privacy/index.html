              <li><strong>Transaction and communications data</strong> related to requests for access, catalog inquiries, orders, and messages exchanged with our team.</li>
              <li><strong>Usage information</strong> collected automatically, including device type, browser, IP address, pages viewed, referring URLs, and interaction data that helps us understand how the Services are used.</li>
              <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> that store preferences and support analytics or authentication.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Provide, operate, and improve the Services, including onboarding, catalog access, and partner communications.</li>
              <li>Verify retailer and brand applications to maintain a trusted wholesale network.</li>
              <li>Respond to inquiries, deliver updates, and send transactional or service-related messages.</li>
              <li>Personalize experiences by tailoring recommendations, assortments, or marketing communications.</li>
              <li>Monitor performance, analyze trends, and maintain the security and integrity of the Services.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>
            <p>We may share information in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>With verified brands or retailers as needed to facilitate wholesale relationships, order fulfillment, or support requests that you initiate.</li>
              <li>If required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
              <li>When necessary to detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
              <li>In connection with a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards.</li>

            <h2>4. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
            <p>We use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies to authenticate sessions, remember preferences, understand how the Services perform, and deliver relevant content. You can adjust your browser settings to limit or disable cookies, though doing so may affect certain functionality.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information against accidental or unlawful access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
